    "There is no shortage of alternatives available for developing Python. The available tools range in complexity from the interactive interface you get by simply typing \"python\" at the commandline in your operating system up to the extremely complex integrated development environments, such as PyCharm or Eclipse. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this course, we'll be using a very popular \"notebook\" based interface called Jupyter. Before you ask, Jupyter admittedly has some significant limitations that mean that it's probably not the tool that you should be using if you're constructing a complex application. But, to be blunt about it, we're not building complex applications right now. Instead, we have basically two goals: (1) to learn enough basic Python to be dangerous and (2) to use Python to perform exploratory analysis. As it turns out, Jupyter is essentially ideal for these tasks:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. It's extremely simple to use\n",
    "2. It's very interactive, so we can get immediate feedback when we try something in Python.\n",
    "3. It's very interactive, so when we eventually move on to data analysis later, it will provide a great environment for interactively exploring, manipulating and visualizing our data\n",
    "4. It will allow us to share things very easily\n",
    "5. It will allow us to embed runnable Python into a document which can include both formatted text, multimedia, and rendered equations, so it's really straightforward to create self-contained, self-documented examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, Jupyter has been broadly adopted as a tool for both teaching basic Python and performing basic data analyses."
