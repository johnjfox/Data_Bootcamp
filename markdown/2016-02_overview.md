#### Acknowledgements

The contents of this course were heavily influenced by the following:

1. a similar series of mini-bootcamps course held at NYU Stern, including a fantastic book that they have published on GitBooks

#### Things to do before the first session

**Before the first session.** 

1. Download Python for your operating system. We'll use the 3.5 version of Python. By far the easiest way to obtain Python and all of the packages and tools that you'll need is to download it and install the [Anaconda Distribution from Continuum][Anaconda]  The instructions for installing the software are on the download page. **Be sure to grab Python 3.5, since there are significant differences between the versions.** 
2. Setting up a Data_Bootcamp directory on you computer wouldn't be a bad idea so that you can keep all of the materials in one place. 
3. Grab the Jupyter notebooks that we'll be using in class. 

**Optional**
1. Conda, which is one component of the Python distribution that you installed, is a very powerful package manager for installing and managing Python environments. If you plan to get serious about using Python, it's worthwhile to go through the [Conda 30-minutes test drive](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/test-drive.html)

Download the code files below.  We'll use three:  one for the data package (Pandas), one for graphics (Matplotlib), and one for examples putting both to use.  Remember to click on the Raw button to get the right file.

**Code files for class.**  [Class 1](https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp/blob/master/Code/Python/bootcamp_fundamentals_1.py) | Class 2  ([data](https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp/blob/master/Code/Python/bootcamp_pandas_1.py) | [graphics](https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp/blob/master/Code/Python/bootcamp_graphics_1.py) | [examples](https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp/blob/master/Code/Python/bootcamp_examples.py)).  Click on the link, then click on the **Raw button** in the upper right, then save in a directory where you can find it.    

**Before the first session.** 
Please install the **Anaconda** distribution of **Python 3.4 or (now) 3.5** from the download page: <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>.  If you have trouble, read [this chapter](https://davebackus.gitbooks.io/test/content/installing-python.html), but keep in mind that the Anaconda download page has changed a little since it was written.  Or come 20 minutes early to the first session and we'll (try to) set you up.  

**Mailing list.**  If you'd like to get announcements about similar events, sign up for the NYU Data Bootcamp [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nyu_data_bootcamp).
