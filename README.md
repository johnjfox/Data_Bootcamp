### Data Bootcamp, Spring 2016 edition  

This document:  https://github.com/johnjfox/Data_Bootcamp/blob/master/markdown/readme.md

A brief overview of the tools and skills you'll learn in **[Data Bootcamp](https://github.com/johnjfox/Data_Bootcamp#data-bootcamp)**.  

March XX and XX, 2-4pm, Questrom *RoomNumber*
* Session 1:  Python fundamentals, examples    
* Session 2:  data management (Pandas), graphics (Matplotlib), examples 

**Be sure to bring your computer to the sessions.**  We'll put it to work.

#### Acknowledgements

The contents of this course were heavily influenced by the following:

1. a similar series of mini-bootcamps course held at NYU Stern, including a fantastic book that they have published on GitBooks

We'll post announcements here.

#### Things to do before the first session

**Before the first session.** 

1. Download Python for your operating system. We'll use the 3.5 version of Python. By far the easiest way to obtain Python and all of the packages and tools that you'll need is to download it and install the [Anaconda Distribution from Continuum][anaconda]  The instructions for installing the software are on the download page. **Be sure to grab Python 3.5, since there are significant differences between the versions.** 
2. Set up a Data_Bootcamp directory on your computer so that you can keep all of the materials in one place. 
3. Grab the Jupyter notebooks that we'll be using in class.
4. Famliarize yourself a bit with Jupyter notebooks by 

**Optional**
1. Conda, which is one component of the Python distribution that you installed, is a very powerful package manager for installing and managing Python environments. If you plan to get serious about using Python, it's worthwhile to go through the [Conda 30-minutes test drive](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/test-drive.html)

Download the code files below.  We'll use three:  one for the data package (Pandas), one for graphics (Matplotlib), and one for examples putting both to use.  Remember to click on the Raw button to get the right file.

**Notebooks for class.**  
There are several ways to obtain the notebooks we'll be using throughout the class. The easiest way is probably to 
#### Session 1:
* [Jupyter Notebooks](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/johnjfox/Data_Bootcamp/blob/master/notebooks/01a_jupyter_notebooks.ipynb) 
* [Fundamentals](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/johnjfox/Data_Bootcamp/blob/master/notebooks/01b_fundamentals.ipynb) 

#### Session 2:
* [Dataframes](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/johnjfox/Data_Bootcamp/blob/master/notebooks/02a_dataframes.ipynb) 

Click on the link, then click on the **Raw button** in the upper right, then save in a directory where you can find it.

#### Python Resources For Data Science Included with Anaconda
*NOTE:* if you installed python using the Anaconda distribution, you should already have these packages and tools installed. 

##### Distributions
* [Anaconda Distribution][anaconda]

##### Tools and IDE's
* [Notebooks][jupyter]


##### Data Science Libraries
* [numpy][numpy]: Python package offering N-dimensional array objects, tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code, and useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities
* [pandas][pandas]: High-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for data analysis, built on numpy
* [scipy][scipy]: efficient numerical routines such as routines for numerical integration and optimization
* [statsmodels][statsmodels]: Python package for exploring data, estimating statistical models, and perform statistical tests, including extensive lists of descriptive statistics, statistical tests, plotting functions, and result statistics are available for different types of data and each estimator.
* [scikit-learn][scikit-learn]: A Python package for machine learning, including capabilities for preprocessing, model selection, clustering, regression, classification, and dimensionality reduction

##### Visualization Libraries
* [matplotlib][matplotlib]: 2D plotting with support for both high level interfaces (a la MATLAB if you happen to know that) or detailed low level control of figure properties
* [seaborn][seaborn]: a 2D plotting library built on matplotlib, with an API that tends to abstact away some of the detailed control over the plotting in order to simplify the creation of plots using a minimal set of arguments.

#### Other Python Resources For Data Science 
This is by no means an exhaustive list of tools or resources for working with Python for data science, however, if you get serious either about Python development in general or about working on data science in particular, then you may want to look into one of these tools. Please note, though, that 

* [Spyder][spyder]: an IDE focused on data science. **Included with Anaconda**
* [Pycharm][pycharm]: a very nice general purpose IDE for Python developed by Jetbrains (the makers of IDEA). **Not included with Anaconda**
* [Rodeo][rodeo]: another IDE for Python development, in this case specifically focused on data science applications. Very feature light, but rapidly evolving **Not included with Anaconda**
* [PyDev][pydev]: IDE for Python development built on Eclipse. **Not included with Anaconda**
